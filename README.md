# Bromine
Bromine is a Java GUI Engine, for rendering GUI to users, it's designed to have internal connectivity, which means if application A uses Bromine and B also uses Bromine, when A and B are running on the same machine, it can send data to each other using Bromine's internal connectivity, or you can disable it by using BromineSettings when started.
Bromine got the name from ... nothing, it's just my favorite element.
